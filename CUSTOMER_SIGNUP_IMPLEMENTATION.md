## User Flow

### For Sellers:
1. Seller logs into their dashboard
2. Navigates to the "Customers" tab
3. Fills out customer registration form
4. Customer receives OTP on their phone
5. Customer enters OTP to complete registration
6. Customer is automatically redirected to `/customer/home`
7. Seller sees success notification

### For Delivery Agents:
1. Delivery agent logs into their dashboard
2. Navigates to the "Customers" tab
3. Fills out customer registration form
4. Customer receives OTP on their phone
5. Customer enters OTP to complete registration
6. Customer is automatically redirected to `/customer/home`
7. Delivery agent sees success notification

## Technical Implementation

### Registration Process
1. **Step 1**: Request OTP
   - Validates required fields
   - Checks for existing users (phone/email)
   - Sends OTP to customer's phone
   - Stores registration data temporarily

2. **Step 2**: Verify OTP
   - Validates OTP entered by customer
   - Creates customer account in database
   - Sets user session cookies
   - Dispatches userLogin event to update header
   - Refreshes router to ensure header state updates
   - Redirects to customer dashboard

### API Integration
- Uses existing `/api/auth/register` endpoint
- Supports `CUSTOMER` user type
- Leverages existing OTP validation logic
- Maintains consistency with existing registration flow

### Database Integration
- Uses existing `customers` table
- Follows same schema as existing customer registration
- No additional database changes required

## Security Features
- OTP-based verification
- Phone number validation
- Email uniqueness check
- Session management
- Form validation

## UI/UX Features
- Responsive design
- Loading states
- Error handling
- Success feedback

- OTP input with visual feedback

## Compatibility

- ✅ Header update functionality verified

## Files Modified
1. `components/CustomerSignupForm.tsx` (new)
2. `app/seller/dashboard/page.tsx` (modified)
3. `app/delivery/dashboard/page.tsx` (modified)
4. `components/ui/header.tsx` (modified - added debug logging)
5. `components/SellerSignupForm.tsx` (modified - added userLogin event dispatch)

## Files Unchanged

- Authentication flow

## Benefits
1. **Enhanced User Experience**: Sellers and delivery agents can help customers register quickly
2. **Increased Conversion**: Reduces friction in customer onboarding
3. **Business Growth**: Enables easier customer acquisition
4. **Consistency**: Follows existing patterns and design
5. **Reliability**: Uses proven OTP-based registration system
6. **Seamless Integration**: Header automatically updates to show logged-in state

## Header Update Fix

### Issue
After user registration (customer, seller, delivery agent), the header still showed "Sign In" and "Join Now" buttons instead of updating to show the user's logged-in state.

### Solution
1. **Event Dispatch**: Added `userLogin` event dispatch in all signup forms after successful registration
2. **Cookie Setting**: Properly set user session cookies using `setCookie` utility
3. **Router Refresh**: Added `router.refresh()` to ensure header state updates
4. **Debug Logging**: Added console logs to track the authentication flow
5. **Timing**: Added small delay to ensure cookies are set before dispatching events

### Technical Details
- All signup forms now dispatch `CustomEvent('userLogin', { detail: data.user })` after registration
- Header component listens for this event and updates its state accordingly
- Router refresh ensures all components reflect the new authentication state
- Fixed in: CustomerSignupForm, SellerSignupForm, DeliveryAgentSignupForm

## Future Enhancements
- Customer list management in dashboards
- Customer analytics for sellers
- Bulk customer registration
- Customer referral system
- Integration with CRM systems
