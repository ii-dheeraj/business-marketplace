# üîß Seller Dashboard Fix Guide

## ‚ùå Current Issue: Cookie Corruption

The seller dashboard is not opening because the authentication cookie contains corrupted data. The `businessImage` field contains a large base64 data URL that's getting truncated, causing JSON parsing to fail.

## ‚úÖ Solution Steps

### 1. Clear Corrupted Cookies

Run the cookie clearing script:

```bash
node clear-corrupted-cookies.js
```

Or manually clear cookies in your browser:
1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to Application/Storage tab
3. Find Cookies section
4. Delete all cookies for localhost:3000

### 2. Restart Development Server

```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

### 3. Sign In Again

1. Go to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Click "Sign In"
3. Select "Seller" as user type
4. Enter your phone number: `8354979824`
5. Check console for OTP (in development mode)
6. Enter the OTP to complete authentication

### 4. Verify Dashboard Access

After signing in, you should be redirected to the seller dashboard at `/seller/dashboard`

## üîß Technical Fixes Applied

### 1. **Cookie Size Limitation**
- Modified login API to store minimal user data in cookies
- Excluded `businessImage` from cookie storage to prevent corruption
- Added proper error handling for corrupted cookies

### 2. **Enhanced Error Handling**
- Added automatic cookie clearing when corruption is detected
- Improved error messages and debugging information
- Added fallback to fetch complete user data from API

### 3. **Data Fetching Strategy**
- Cookie stores essential user info (ID, name, email, etc.)
- Business image is fetched separately from API when needed
- Prevents cookie size limits from affecting functionality

## üß™ Testing the Fix

### Test 1: Authentication Flow
1. Clear all cookies
2. Sign in as seller
3. Verify redirect to dashboard
4. Check that profile image loads correctly

### Test 2: Cookie Integrity
1. Check browser developer tools
2. Verify cookie size is reasonable (< 4KB)
3. Confirm no truncated data in cookie

### Test 3: Dashboard Functionality
1. Verify all tabs work (Products, Orders, Profile)
2. Check that business image displays correctly
3. Test profile editing functionality

3. **Fetch complete data from API when needed**
4. **Implement proper error handling for cookie parsing**
5. **Regularly monitor cookie sizes**
